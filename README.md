Assignmet 3: Prime Factors
Durham College Python Development 2 course

ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------
In this assignment, you will build an algorithm that will generate a list of the prime factors for a given number.

Prime factors (also known as prime numbers or a prime) are numbers which cannot be formed as the result of a multiplication.

Using the Three Rules of TDD, develop the algorithm based on each assertion listed below. After each step commit your work using git commit.

Write a function called generate_prime_factors in the module prime.py. This function will accept an integer as an argument, and return a list of integers.
